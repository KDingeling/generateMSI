===========

UNTESTED WORK IN PROGRESS


Copyright 2013 Lloyd K. Konneker


About
-----

A python script that generates a .msi (MS Installer) file.
Uses WiX toolset (which only runs on Windows, so this only runs on Windows.)


License
-------

GPLv3+


Requirements
------------

Requires of the machine it runs on:
- WiX toolset installed (which requires Windows OS)
- Python installed


Features
--------

The scripting automates:
- editing of the WiX input XML (simplifies it by using Python templates.)
- calling of the WiX toolset

Capability: VERY LIMITED.
This creates a very simple MSI, for a very simple case.
In other words, it is hardcoded and inflexible except for a few parameters.
The same name is used ubuiquitously for the product, company, websites, certain directories, etc.
It also installs a fixed set of components.
In other words: specific to a company with a single product, where the product has its own mimetype.

See more description in the docstring.
